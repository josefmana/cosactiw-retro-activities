### VLS-ALQ

Dimensionality of the VLS-ALQ questionnaire scale in our sample was first checked via the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) as implemented in the "lavaan" R package [@lavaan; @rsoft]. A three-factor model with separate "Private," "Public," and "Religious" independent dimensions, a second order factor model with separate "Private," "Public," and "Religious" and a superordinate "Total" factor, and separate unidimensional models for the "Private" and the "Public" subscales were fitted to data. Models were evaluated via Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and root-mean-square-error-aproximation (RMSEA) with values of TLI > .9, CFI > .9, and RMSEA < .08 considered to indicate adequate fit. Next, internal consistency of the full questionnaire and the "Public" and the "Private" subscales was estimated via the Cronbach's $\alpha$ and Guttman's Lambda 6 (G6). Internal consistency indexes were estimated in the "psych" R package using the default settings [@psych; @rsoft]. Following the classical recommendations for interpretation of coefficient $\alpha$ [@streiner2003; @nunnally1994], we consider values above 0.7 as sufficient for early research, values above 0.8 as sufficient for basic research, and values above 0.9 as necessary for clinical use.

Sum scores of the full VLS-ALQ questionnaire as well as its subscales were described by their in-sample means $\pm$ standard deviations for SA and non-SA groups separately. The null hypothesis that SA and non-SA groups' means are equal was tested via the independent sample *t*-test with Welch modification to the degrees of freedom and effect size of mean differences characterised by Cohen's d. The null hypothesis of stachastical uniformity between distribution of test scores in SA and non-SA groups was tested via the Mann-Whitney U test with effect size characterised by Vargha and Delaney A as implemented in the *effsize* R package [@effsize; @vargha2000]. Decision threshold for claiming statistically significant deviance from a null hypothesis in these comparisons was set at p < .05.

### COBRA-A

*To be added, by someone else hopefully :-)*

### Leisure activities

The self-reported leisure activities' distributions were described in three ways: (i) as counts of activity type per participant, (ii) as a number of participants reporting at least one activity of each activity type, and (iii) as a time-series of expected means of self-reported intensity ratings.

The counts of activity type were described separately for SA and non-SA groups stratified by modality (physical, mental, both) and seasoness (seasonal, non-seasonal) by their in-sample means $\pm$ standard deviations. Null hypotheses of equal means and stochastical uniformity of SA versus non-SA activity type counts distributions were tested via *t*-test with Welch modification to the degrees of freedom and the Mann-Whitney U test respectively. Effect sizes of differences between SA and non-SA means and distributions were described by Cohen's d and Vargha and Delaney A (VD.A) as implemented in the "effsize" R package [@effsize; @vargha2000]. Decision threshold for claiming statistically significant deviance from a null hypothesis in these comparisons was set at p < .05.^[***Note from Pepa, not to be included in the final text. I used the "vanilla approach" of testing nulls about mean differences and stochastical equality, however, the very viable alternative would be a set of GLMs (regressions) with Poisson or Negative Binomial likelihood which are good candidates for modelling count variables. The choice between methods depends on the type of answer we are looking for (i.e., the estimand). Do we want just compare distributions of these counts with not many assumptions? Then the vanilla approach might work well. Or do we want a way to compare distributions and derive sensible predictions? Then the "regression approach" would be better. Do we want causal instead of descriptive estimates? Then we need to put more work into the pre-statistic scientific model building. Pick your poison I guess :-D***]

The number of participants reporting at least one activity belonging to a given activity type was described by contingency tables separately for each modality (physical, mental, both), seasoness (seasonal, non-seasonal), and SA status (SA, non-SA). Within each modality/seasoness combination, the Pearson's $\chi^2$ test of the null hypothesis that SA status and activity type are independent of each other was performed. The strength of association between SA status and activity type was described by Cramérs' V as implemented in the "rcompanion" package [@rcompanion]. Decision threshold for claiming statistically significant deviance from a null hypothesis in these comparisons was set at p < .05.

Finally, the expected means of self-reported intensities of single leisure activities across lifetime were modelled via a set of Bayesian Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) with time (decade of life) as a monotonic predictor [@bürkner2017b; @bürkner2020]. The GLMMs (specified below) were fitted to data and used to generate posterior draws of the expected value of the activtiy intensity conditional on different combinations of life decade, SA status, seasoness and modality as predictors of interest. These posterior draws were then described by their medians and 95% equal tailed posterior intervals (ETIs). Moreover, pairwise comparisons between expected intensity conditional on decades of life, SA status, modality and seasoness were directly compared and evaluated by the probability of direction (*pd*) index of effect existence [@makowski2019].

Since there was no mental activity that would also be seasonal, two GLMMs were fitted. In the first model, the self-reported intensity of non-seasonal activities was regressed on the decade of life (monotonic ordered predictor), SA status, modality, and their two- and three-way interactions on group-level as well as correlated participant- and activity type-specific intercepts and slopes across decades. This model was used to estimate expectations of nonseasonal activities' intensity ratings conditional on a decade of life, SA status and activity modality. In the second model, the self-reported intensity of physical activities was regressed on the decade of life (monotonic ordered predictor), SA status, seasoness, and their two- and three-way interactions on group-level as well as correlated participant- and activity type-specigic intercepts and slopes across decades. This model was used to estimate expectations of intensity ratings conditional on decade of life, SA status and seasoness of physical activities.^[***Another message from Pepa. It would be best to add full model specification to Appendix. I will do so but it will take some time so I would wait until the article takes a more concete form on itself before I allocate time to Appendix activity.***]

All GLMMs were fitted using Stan’s (version `r stan_version()`) build-in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler accessed via R version `r with( version, paste(major,minor,sep=".") )` using package “brms” [@bürkner2017; @rsoft; @stan]. Four parallel chains were run each for 2,000 iterations for each GLMM. The first 1,000 iterations served as a warm-up and were discarded. Convergence was checked numerically by inspection of the $\hat{R}s$ and visually by inspection of trace plots. Posterior predictive checks for each combination of predictors was used to check whether the models reliably reproduce in-sample means and standard deviations. This study’s design and its analysis were not pre-registered. The data are not publicly available due to privacy or ethical restrictions. The computer code used in the data analysis can be accessed at [https://github.com/josefmana/cosactiw-retro-activities.git](https://github.com/josefmana/cosactiw-retro-activities.git).

# Results

for ( i in names( readRDS( here("_data.rds") ) ) ) assign( i, readRDS( here("_data.rds") )[[i]] ) # data
d <- left_join(cog, dem, by = "ID")

N <- as.matrix( table(d$SA) ) # number of SA/nonSA ladies

# extract age, education info
demo <-
  
  # extract means ± SDs
  d %>%
  group_by(SA) %>%
  summarise( across( all_of( c("Age_years","Education_years") ), msd ) ) %>%
  column_to_rownames("SA") %>%
  t() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  
  # add t-test results
  mutate(
    t = rprint(unlist(sapply( rownames(.), function(y) t.test( as.formula( paste0(y," ~ SA") ), data = d )$statistic ), use.names = F) , d = 3),
    df = rprint(unlist(sapply( rownames(.), function(y) t.test( as.formula( paste0(y," ~ SA") ), data = d )$parameter ), use.names = F) , d = 2),
    p = zerolead(unlist(sapply( rownames(.), function(y) t.test( as.formula( paste0(y," ~ SA") ), data = d )$p.value ), use.names = F) , d = 3),
  )

```

Overall, there was a total of `r N['SA', ]` women categorised as SA (`r demo['Age_years', 'SA']` years old, `r demo['Education_years', 'SA']` years of education), and `r N['nonSA', ]` women categorised as non-SA (`r demo['Age_years', 'nonSA']` years old, `r demo['Education_years', 'nonSA']` years of education). The null hypothesis of equal means was not rejected for neither age (t(`r demo['Age_years', 'df']`) = `r demo['Age_years', 't']`, p = `r demo['Age_years', 'p']`) nor education (t(`r demo['Education_years', 'df']`) = `r demo['Education_years', 't']`, p = `r demo['Education_years', 'p']`).

## VLS-ALQ

```{r}
#| label: vls-icon

# prepare a table with internal consistency measures
icon <-
  read.csv( here("tables","vls_reliabilities.csv"), sep = "," ) %>%
  select(Scale, std.alpha, G6.smc.) %>%
  filter( !is.na(std.alpha) ) %>%
  column_to_rownames("Scale") %>%
  mutate_all(rprint, 3)

```

The 'total' VLS-ALQ scale ($\alpha$ = `r icon['Total','std.alpha']`, G6 = `r icon['Total','G6.smc.']`), as well as the 'private' subscale ($\alpha$ = `r icon['Private','std.alpha']`, G6 = `r icon['Private','G6.smc.']`) and the 'public' subscale ($\alpha$ = `r icon['Public','std.alpha']`, G6 = `r icon['Public','G6.smc.']`) showed low levels of internal consistency an inadequate fit of CFAs to data in the current sample (see @tbl-vls-reli). Consequently, the following results ought to be interpreted with the low internal consistency in mind as this could severely decrease statistical power. The statistical comparisons of means and distributions of VLS-ALQ scores in non-SA versus SA participants are presented in @tbl-vls-comps. No null hypothesis was rejected based on our data.

## Leisure activities

### Counts of activity types

```{r}
#| label: la-counts

# read the table for further work
la_counts <-
  read.csv(here("tables","la_activities_counts.csv"), sep = ";") %>%
  filter( !(category == "flexibility_health_exercise" & season == "Seasonal & Non-seasonal") )

```

Counts of activities per participant per SA and non-SA group and their comparison are presented in @tbl-la-counts. No tested null hypothesis was rejected apart from the hypothesis of zero difference in means (t(`r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_ttest) < .05 )$df`) = `r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_ttest) < .05 )$t_stat`, p = `r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_ttest) < .05 )$p_ttest`) and stochastical uniformity (W = `r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_mannwhitney) < .05 )$W`, p = `r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_mannwhitney) < .05 )$p_mannwhitney`) of distributions of counts of `r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_ttest) < .05 )$category`. The SA participants reported relatively more `r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_ttest) < .05 )$category` than non-SA participants (SA: `r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_ttest) < .05 )$SA`, non-SA: `r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_ttest) < .05 )$nonSA`, Cohen's d = `r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_ttest) < .05 )$cohens_d`, VD.A = `r subset(la_counts, as.numeric(p_mannwhitney) < .05 )$VD.A`).^[***Another note to be deleted later. If we opt to use any adjustment for multiple comparisons, these hypotheses will remain unrejected as well.***]

```{r}
#| label: tbl-la-counts
#| tbl-cap: Description and statistical comparison of activity counts in SA and non-SA groups

la_counts %>%
  
  gt(groupname_col = "season") %>%
  cols_align(columns = -c(1:3), align = "center") %>%
  
  # group columns together
  tab_spanner(columns = ends_with("SA"), label = "Descriptive statistics", gather = F) %>%
  tab_spanner(columns = all_of( c("cohens_d","t_stat","df","p_ttest") ), label = "t-test", gather = F) %>%
  tab_spanner(columns = all_of( c("VD.A","W","p_mannwhitney") ), label = "Mann Whitney U test", gather = F) %>%

  )

```

### Number of participants reporting an activity

```{r}
#| label: la-nums

# read the chi-squared test results
lanums <-
  read.csv(here("tables","la_participants_numbers_chisquared.csv"), sep = ",") %>%
  mutate( p = zerolead(p) )

```

Overall distribution of the number of participants engaging in at least one activity from each activity type is presented in @tbl-la-nums-all. Based on the data, the null hypothesis of activity type and SA status independence was not rejected for neither physical ($\chi^2$(`r subset(lanums, season == "all" & type == "physical")$df`) = `r subset(lanums, season == "all" & type == "physical")$chisq`, p = `r subset(lanums, season == "all" & type == "physical")$p`, Cramér's V = `r subset(lanums, season == "all" & type == "physical")$cramer_v`) nor mental ($\chi^2$(`r subset(lanums, season == "non-seasonal" & type == "mental")$df`) = `r subset(lanums, season == "non-seasonal" & type == "mental")$chisq`, p = `r subset(lanums, season == "non-seasonal" & type == "mental")$p`, Cramér's V = `r subset(lanums, season == "non-seasonal" & type == "mental")$cramer_v`) activities. Furthermore, in the case of physical activities, the null hypothesis of independence between distributions of activity type and SA status was not rejected for neither non-seasonal ($\chi^2$(`r subset(lanums, season == "non-seasonal" & type == "physical")$df`) = `r subset(lanums, season == "non-seasonal" & type == "physical")$chisq`, p = `r subset(lanums, season == "non-seasonal" & type == "physical")$p`, Cramér's V = `r subset(lanums, season == "non-seasonal" & type == "physical")$cramer_v`) nor seasonal ($\chi^2$(`r subset(lanums, season == "seasonal" & type == "physical")$df`) = `r subset(lanums, season == "seasonal" & type == "physical")$chisq`, p = `r subset(lanums, season == "seasonal" & type == "physical")$p`, Cramér's V = `r subset(lanums, season == "seasonal" & type == "physical")$cramer_v`) activities (see @tbl-la-nums-physical).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-la-nums-all
#| tbl-cap: Number of participants reporting at least one mental or physical activity of each type

read.csv(here("tables","la_all_participants_numbers.csv"), sep = ",") %>%
  
  select( -ends_with("SA") ) %>%
  relocate(nonSA_perc, .before = SA_perc) %>%
  mutate( Type = capitalise(Type) ) %>%
  
  gt(groupname_col = "Type") %>%
  cols_align(columns = -c(1:2), align = "center") %>%
  cols_label(
    Category ~ "Activity type",
    SA_perc ~ "SA",
    nonSA_perc~"non-SA"
  )

```

### Intensity ratings

```{r}
#| label: glmms

fit <- list(
  phys = readRDS( here("models","ordered_time_physical.rds") ),
  nsea = readRDS( here("models","ordered_time_nonseasonal.rds") )
)

# extract rhats
rhatmax <- ubound( max( sapply(names(fit), function(i) max( rhat(fit[[i]]) ) ) ), 3)

```

Both GLMMs converged in specified number of iterations to a stationary posterior distribution ($\hat{R}s \leq `r rhatmax`$). Both models showed adequate reproduction of sample means (@fig-ppc-nonseasonal-mean and @fig-ppc-physical-mean) and standard deviations (@fig-ppc-nonseasonal-sd and @fig-ppc-physical-sd) but not the shapes of sample distributions (@fig-ppc-nonseasonal-dens and @fig-ppc-physical-dens).

The results are summarised in @fig-nonseasonal-cond-means. Left and right panels show the same thing from different point of views. Left panel shows pretty clearly that self-reported intensity/frequency of physical non-seasonal leisure activities decreases with age while self-reported intensity/frequency of mental leisure activities increases with age. The right panel shows pretty clearly that this tendency is the same in SA and nonSA participants.

The results are summarised in @fig-physical-cond-means. Left and right panels show the same thing from different point of views. Left panel shows that self-reported intensity/frequency of non-seasonal leisure activities decreases more slowly with age than does self-reported intensity/frequency of seasonal leisure activities. It can also be seen there, that the slope (i.e., speed) of decrease is somewhat different between SA and nonSA groups. Better seen in the right panel is the finding that whereas the self-reported intensity/frequency of non-seasonal physical activities is practically identical between SA and nonSA groups, the SA participants reported less frequency/intensity of seasonal physical leisure activities across ages.
